# Unexpected Null Values in Dart Getters

This repository demonstrates a potential issue related to handling nullable types and default values in Dart getters.  The code showcases how the null-aware operator (`??`) can be used to handle potential null values, but it also highlights the importance of carefully considering how null values might propagate through the code and potentially lead to unexpected results.

The example uses a simple class with a nullable integer variable. The getter uses `??` to return a default value (0) if the variable is null. The main function demonstrates the usage and output. The solution shows alternative approaches for handling nulls more robustly.
